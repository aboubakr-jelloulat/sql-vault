-- In SQL, the EXISTS keyword is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery. It returns TRUE if the subquery returns at least one row, and FALSE if it returns no rows

-- The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

-- 	Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
-- 	The columns must also have similar data types
-- 	The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order
